Client: Company A, Bengaluru. D2C home textiles brand selling on its own website, 3 marketplaces and 2 quick-commerce apps. 45 staff, revenue Rs 38-45 crore a year, finance team of 3.
Today: Shipping runs through 2 courier aggregators, and 55% of website orders are cash on delivery (COD). Each month finance downloads settlement, COD remittance and freight invoice reports into Excel and matches them with lookups. Returns are rarely checked against what reached the warehouse. Books are in Tally.
Problem: Assumptions: 30,000 orders a month at Rs 1,200 average, Rs 43.2 crore a year. 1.5% of order value leaks through unremitted COD, wrong fees, wrong weight slabs and lost returns: Rs 64.8 lakh. Finance spends 60% of its time reconciling: Rs 10.8 lakh. Total Rs 75.6 lakh a year, and month-end close takes 12 days.
Users: Finance executives, the returns manager, and the finance co-founder, who signs the deal.
The ask: We know money is leaking but we can't say where. I want to upload every partner's reports and see, per order, whether we were paid the right amount. Anything short, late or overcharged should land in a claims list with evidence. Returns that never arrived must be caught within days.
Must have:
- Upload of order, settlement, COD and freight files (CSV or Excel) with column mapping saved per source
- Order-level matching with statuses: settled, short-paid, unpaid past due, freight overcharged, return not received
- Rate cards per channel and courier to compute expected amounts and flag gaps over Rs 10
- Returns tracker against warehouse receipt scans
- Claims list by partner with evidence export, and a money-at-risk dashboard by partner and age
- Partner-wise summary of TCS and TDS deducted
CORE BUILD: Software Engineering candidates must ship this slice end to end, in about 6 to 8 screens: file upload with saved column mapping, order-level matching, rate-card expected amounts, claims list, and money-at-risk view. Roles: finance executive and co-founder. AI: column mapping suggestions. Hard part: matching 1 lakh rows in under a minute. Mock payments, messages and outside systems, and seed from the sample data. The rest of MUST HAVE is optional depth.
Out of scope: Storefront or inventory sync; GST filing; Automatic claim filing.
AI or automation: Matching and expected amounts are rules, not AI. AI proposes column mappings when a partner changes its format, and suggests matches when an order ID is missing. When it is wrong: mappings are previewed on 20 rows, approved before saving, and versioned for rollback. Suggested matches go to a review queue and are never closed automatically.
Constraints: Customer names, phones and addresses are personal data under the DPDP Act 2023, so mask them where not needed. Settlements deduct GST TCS and income tax TDS, which must be shown separately, not as leakage. Files of 1 lakh rows should process in under a minute. Formats change without notice.
Design: The client values good, minimal design: clean layouts, white space, a restrained palette and clear type, with nothing on screen that lacks a purpose. Design counts as much as features. Finance staff work through large tables: make differences and money at risk stand out, and keep filters simple.
Budget and time: Rs 6.5 lakh, 6 weeks. Success: 98% of orders auto-matched; month-end close from 12 days to 3; at least Rs 30 lakh recovered through claims in year one.
